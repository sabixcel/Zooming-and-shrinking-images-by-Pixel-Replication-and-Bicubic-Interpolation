# Zooming and shrinking images by Pixel Replication and Bicubic Interpolation

The files to be run is ResizeImage and main.
Images need to be in the same folder as the source code.

This project involves the numerical processing of images, namely the enlargement and reduction of images by 2 methods: Pixel Replication and Bicubic Interpolation (BI).
The bicubic interpolation method uses a Kernel function for optimal performance.
The project also provides a GUI, documentation with several theoretical explanations and a ppt presentation.
