# Zooming and shrinking images by Pixel Replication and Bicubic Interpolation
This is a faculty group project. It involves the numerical processing of images, namely the zooming and shrinking of images by 2 methods: Pixel Replication and Bicubic Interpolation (BI). The bicubic interpolation method uses a Kernel function for optimal performance. Moreover, the project provides a GUI, documentation with several theoretical explanations and a ppt presentation.

The files to be run is ResizeImage.py and main.py.
Images need to be in the same folder as the source code.
